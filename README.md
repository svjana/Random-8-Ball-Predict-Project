# Random-8-Ball-Predict-Project
This code creates a "magic 8 ball" program that will ask a user for their name, and then ask them a question. It will then generate a random number between 0 and 7 (inclusive), and use that number to determine a response from the magic 8 ball. The response will be printed to the console.
